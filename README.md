# Constant-Depth Circuits for Simulating Dynamics of Materials on Quantum Computers. 
Code to generate constant-depth circuits for dynamic simulations of materials on quantum computers.  Included are two python notebooks which demonstrate how to generate constant-depth circuits for simulating dynamics of the XY model and the transvserse field Ising model.  The notebooks include step-by-step tutorials for generating both constant-depth circuits as well as IBM-compiled circuits for simulating quantum quenches of these two models.  If the user has an IBM Quantum Experience account (which can be made free of change), then all the circuits can be executed on IBM's quantum simulator and real quantum processors for comparison.  We recommmend opening the notebooks within Jupyter. More details on our constant-depth circuits can be found in our **[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07429)**.  We find that our constant-depth circuits dramatically improve performance of dynamic simalations on quantum computers and pave the way towards successful implementation of long-time dynamic simulations that are necessary for the observation of interesting and important atomic-level physics.
